# My Neovim Configuration

I haven't done much changes to the base LazyVim configuration because it's great.

My small modifications:

- [x] Evil Lualine
- [x] Codeium

This works for me. If you're having issues with the tab completion, take a look at this [issue](https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium.vim/issues/11).
